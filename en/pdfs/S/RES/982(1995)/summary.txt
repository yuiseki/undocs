 The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the search for an overall negotiated settlement of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the States there within their internationally recognized borders. The Council welcomed the acceptance by the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of the Contact Group peace plan, and the agreements between the Bosnian parties on a cease-fire and on the complete cessation of hostilities. The Council authorized the Secretary-General to redeploy UNPROFOR personnel and assets from the Republic of Croatia, and extended UNPROFORâ€™s mandate in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina for an additional period terminating on 30 November 1995. The Council also called upon Member States to consider favourably requests by the Secretary-General for necessary assistance to UNPROFOR in the performance of its mandate.
