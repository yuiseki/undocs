 The Security Council of the United Nations adopted Resolution 997 (1995) to extend the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) until December 8, 1995, and to reduce the force level to 2,330 troops within three months and 1,800 troops within four months. The resolution also calls for increased efforts to assist the Government of Rwanda in the promotion of a climate of stability and trust, and for increased international assistance for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Rwanda. It also calls for the deployment of United Nations military observers to monitor the sale or supply of arms and matériel to persons in the States neighbouring Rwanda, and for the fulfilment of earlier commitments to give assistance for Rwanda’s rehabilitation efforts.
