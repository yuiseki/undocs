  "summary": " In 1952, the Security Council adopted resolutions and decisions regarding the India-Pakistan question based on the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan resolutions of 1948 and 1949. The Security Council endorses the general principles of the United Nations Representative's efforts to bring about agreement between India and Pakistan, but agreement on a plan of demilitarization of the State of Jammu and Kashmir has not been reached. The Council urges the governments to enter into immediate negotiations and requests the governments to report to the Security Council within thirty days and the United Nations Representative to keep the Security Council informed of any progress.",
