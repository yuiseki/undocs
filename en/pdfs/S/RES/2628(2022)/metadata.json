  "summary": " The United Nations Security Council Resolution 2628 (2022) reaffirms the need for international support to enable Somalia to achieve its aim of a secure, stable, peaceful, united and democratic country. It calls for the reconfiguration of the African Union Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) to combat terrorist threats, and for international cooperation and support for peacebuilding and post-conflict reconstruction and development in Somalia. It also calls for the implementation of the National Security Architecture, the Somali Transition Plan, and a fully functioning federal system. It further calls for the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and for the prevention of violence against children. It authorizes the deployment of up to 19,626 uniformed personnel from the African Union to carry out operations in compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law, and requests the African Union to ensure structures are in place to provide oversight and accountability of the mission. It also requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide a logistical support package, and develop an appropriate logistical support plan, in full compliance with HRDDP, through UNSOS for UNSOM, ATMIS uniformed personnel, and up to 13,900 Somali security forces.",
