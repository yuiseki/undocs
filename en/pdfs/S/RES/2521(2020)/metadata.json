  "summary": " The UN Security Council has adopted Resolution 2521 (2020) to welcome encouraging developments in South Sudan's peace process, including the formation of a Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity (RTGNU). The resolution expresses concern regarding the political, security, economic, and humanitarian situation in South Sudan, and strongly condemns past and ongoing human rights violations and abuses. It also calls for the inspection of cargo to South Sudan for items prohibited by resolution 2428 (2018), and for the imposition of targeted sanctions to support the search for an inclusive and sustainable peace in South Sudan. The resolution also extends the mandate of the Panel of Experts until July 2021, and requests the Special Representatives of the Secretary-General to share relevant information.",
