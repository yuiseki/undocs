  "summary": " The Security Council adopted Resolution 968 (1994) to establish a United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan (UNMOT) to assist in maintaining the cease-fire, investigate reports of cease-fire violations, provide its good offices, maintain close contacts with the parties to the conflict, provide support for the efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy, and provide political liaison and coordination services. The resolution also calls for the parties to cooperate fully with the Mission, release detainees and prisoners of war, and refrain from any steps that could aggravate the existing situation or hinder the process towards national reconciliation. It also requests the Secretary-General to establish a voluntary fund for contributions in support of the implementation of the Agreement of 17 September 1994.",
