 The Security Council of the United Nations adopted Resolution 972 (1995) in order to extend the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) and to express deep concern at the failure of the Liberian parties to reach agreement on the composition of the Council of State. The resolution also calls on the Liberian leaders and factions to maintain the cease-fire, recommit to the disarmament process, and implement the Accra Agreement. It also demands that all factions in Liberia respect the status of ECOMOG and UNOMIL personnel, and those of organizations and personnel delivering humanitarian assistance. Finally, it commends the efforts of Member States and humanitarian organizations to provide emergency humanitarian assistance and the commitment of ECOMOG to ensure the safety of UNOMIL military observers and civilian staff.
