  "summary": " The Security Council of the United Nations adopted Resolution 992 (1995) to promote free and unhindered navigation on the Danube in accordance with previous resolutions. The resolution allows vessels registered in, or owned or controlled by persons in, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to use the locks of the Iron Gates I system on the left hand bank of the Danube while repairs are carried out to the locks on the right hand bank. The resolution also requests the Government of Romania to monitor this use and to deny passage through the locks to any vessel suspected of violating relevant Council resolutions.",
