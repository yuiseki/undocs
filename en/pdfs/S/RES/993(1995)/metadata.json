  "summary": " The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia, expressed concern over the critical funding shortages which may result in suspension of important humanitarian programmes, and paid tribute to those members of the CIS peace-keeping force who have lost their lives in the exercise of their duties. The Council also welcomed the report of the Secretary-General of 1 May 1995, extended the mandate of UNOMIG for an additional period, expressed its full support for the efforts of the Secretary-General aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict, and called upon the parties to reach substantive progress in the negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations.",
