 The Security Council adopted Resolution 975 (1995) in order to recognize the positive developments in Haiti, including the departure of the former military leadership, the return of the legitimately elected President, and the restoration of the legitimate authorities. The resolution also authorizes the Secretary-General to recruit and deploy military contingents, civilian police and other personnel to the United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) in order to create a secure and stable environment. The resolution also requests the Secretary-General to establish a fund to support the international police monitoring programme and assist with the creation of an adequate police force in Haiti.
