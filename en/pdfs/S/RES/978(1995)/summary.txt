 The Security Council recalled its previous resolutions on the situation in Rwanda, expressed grave concern at reports of genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law, and noted the obligations of resolution 955 (1994) which created the International Tribunal for Rwanda. The Council condemned attacks against persons in refugee camps near the borders of Rwanda, urged states to arrest and detain persons found within their territory against whom there is sufficient evidence of responsibility for acts within the jurisdiction of the International Tribunal for Rwanda, and decided to remain actively seized of the matter.
