 The UN Security Council Resolution 2500 (2019) reaffirms its condemnation of piracy and hostage-taking off the coast of Somalia, and calls for international cooperation to prevent and suppress piracy and tackle its underlying causes. It also calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all seafarers held hostage by Somali pirates, and encourages the Federal Government of Somalia to accede to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. It further calls upon all States to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of all persons responsible for or associated with acts of piracy and armed robbery off the coast of Somalia, and requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council within eleven months on the implementation of the resolution and the situation with respect to piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia.
