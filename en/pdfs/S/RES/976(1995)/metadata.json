The Council also urged the expeditious deployment of military and police observers to monitor the cease-fire, authorized the deployment of planning and support elements, and endorsed the Secretary-General's view on the need for UNAVEM III to have an effective information capability. The Council further requested the Secretary-General to inform the Council monthly of progress in the deployment of UNAVEM III and in implementation of the Lusaka Protocol, and welcomed the presence of the OAU Ministerial delegation.",
