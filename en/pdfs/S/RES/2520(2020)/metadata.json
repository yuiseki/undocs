  "summary": " The UN Security Council Resolution 2520 (2020) calls for the Federal Government of Somalia (FGS) and its Federal Member States (FMS) to make progress on transition and to take concrete action to fulfill priority measures in the 2019 Mutual Accountability Framework essential to Somali security. It authorizes the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) to carry out priority tasks to achieve the objectives of maintaining a presence in population centres, reconfiguring in line with a Somali-led updated Transition Plan, mentoring and assisting Somali security forces, and securing and maintaining key supply routes. It also requests the Secretary-General to provide logistical and financial support to UNSOM, AMISOM uniformed personnel, and 70 AMISOM civilians, as well as 13,900 Somali security forces. The resolution also calls for the FGS and FMS to support the state and federal police, combat the illicit trade of small arms and light weapons, ensure one-person-one-vote elections, and take action to prevent the killing, maiming and abduction of children.",
