  "summary": " The Security Council of the United Nations reaffirmed its commitment to the search for an overall negotiated settlement of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, and condemned all unacceptable acts directed at the personnel of the United Nations peace-keeping forces. The Council demanded that the parties complete the withdrawal of all their troops from the zones of separation, and requested the Secretary-General to make the necessary arrangements to ensure full deployment of UNCRO. The Council also requested the Secretary-General to assess the humanitarian situation of the local Serb population in Sector West, and demanded that the parties refrain from taking any further military measures or actions that could lead to the escalation of the situation.",
