 The Security Council recalled its previous resolutions on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, and took note of a letter and communication concerning a major resurgence of diphtheria in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The Council recognized that the export of anti-serum from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) would require an exemption from the provisions of resolution 757 (1992) of 30 May 1992, and thus adopted Resolution 967 (1994) to permit the export of 12,000 vials of diphtheria anti-serum for a period of thirty days, with payments to be made only into frozen accounts.
