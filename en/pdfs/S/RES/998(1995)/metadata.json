  "summary": " The Security Council of the United Nations reaffirmed the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and condemned the continuing armed hostilities in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It expressed deep regret that the parties were not able to agree to a further cease-fire and grave concern that the obstruction of humanitarian assistance and the denial of the use of Sarajevo airport by the Bosnian Serb side threatened the ability of the United Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina to carry out its mandate. The Council authorized an increase in UNPROFOR personnel by up to 12,500 additional troops and requested the Secretary-General to take full account of the need to enhance their security.",
