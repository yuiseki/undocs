 The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and welcomed the positive role played by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Council approved the arrangements contained in the Secretary-General's report of 22 March 1995, and decided that UNPROFOR shall be known as the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) with a mandate terminating on 30 November 1995. The Council also urged UNPREDEP to continue the current cooperation between UNPROFOR and the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, and called upon Member States to consider favourably requests by the Secretary-General for necessary assistance to UNPREDEP in the performance of its mandate.
