  "summary": " The Security Council reaffirmed its commitment to holding a free, fair and impartial referendum for self-determination of the people of Western Sahara in accordance with the Settlement Plan. It commended the progress in identifying potential voters since the beginning of the year, but expressed concern that certain practices are hampering further progress. The Council decided to send a mission to the region and to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 30 June 1995. It also decided to consider the further extension of the mandate of MINURSO beyond 30 June 1995 in the light of the Secretary-General's report.",
