  "summary": "\nThe Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, adopted Resolution 986 (1995) to provide for the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population until Iraq fulfills relevant Security Council resolutions. The resolution authorizes the import of petroleum and petroleum products from Iraq, with payment of the full amount going into an escrow account established by the Secretary-General. The funds in the escrow account are to be used to finance the export of medicine, health supplies, foodstuffs, and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs, to provide humanitarian relief to all segments of the Iraqi population, and to meet other costs associated with the resolution. The resolution also authorizes the export of parts and equipment essential for the safe operation of the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline system in Iraq.",
