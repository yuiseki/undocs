 The Security Council adopted Resolution 2629 (2022) to extend the mandate of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) until July 31, 2022. The resolution reaffirms the Council's commitment to a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned political process, and calls for the implementation of the timeline elaborated in the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) roadmap. It also demands full compliance with the arms embargo imposed under Resolution 1970 (2011), and requests the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council on the implementation of the resolution every 30 days.
