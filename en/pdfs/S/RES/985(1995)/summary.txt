 The Security Council, recalling its previous resolutions on Liberia, expressed deep concern that the cease-fire in Liberia has broken down and that arms continue to be imported in violation of resolution 788 (1992). It decided to extend the mandate of UNOMIL until 30 June 1995, urged all Liberian parties to implement the Akosombo and Accra Agreements, encouraged ECOWAS to promote implementation of the Agreements, and urged all States to comply with the embargo on all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Liberia. It also requested the Secretary-General to report to the Security Council by 15 June 1995 on the situation in Liberia.
