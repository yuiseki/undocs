  "summary": " The Security Council adopted Resolution 969 (1994) to extend the stationing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) for a further period of six months. The resolution also calls upon the military authorities on both sides to ensure that no incidents occur along the buffer zone and to extend their full cooperation to UNFICYP, as well as urges all concerned to commit themselves to a significant reduction in the number of foreign troops in the Republic of Cyprus and a reduction of defence spending in the Republic of Cyprus. The resolution also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of the resolution by 15 June 1995.",
