  "summary": " The Security Council reaffirmed its resolution 982 (1995) of 31 March 1995 and expressed its grave concern at the continued fighting in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina despite the agreements on a cease-fire and complete cessation of hostilities. It condemned the attacks on UNPROFOR personnel and demanded that all parties and others concerned refrain from any act of intimidation or violence against UNPROFOR and its personnel. It also called upon the Bosnian parties to agree to an extension of the agreements on a cease-fire and complete cessation of hostilities and urged all parties and others concerned to resume negotiations towards an overall peaceful settlement on the basis of the acceptance of the Contact Group peace plan.",
