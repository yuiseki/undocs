  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/263B on 18 April 2023, which reaffirms the International Civil Service Commission's standards of travel and requests the Secretary-General to limit the use of exceptions, strengthen internal controls, and encourage eminent and prominent persons to voluntarily downgrade from their entitled class. The resolution also requests the Secretary-General to review the programme budget for 2023, including the lump-sum option for home leave, the use of online booking tools, and the standards of accommodation for air travel and daily subsistence allowance. It also takes note of the report of the Secretary-General, the findings of the report of the Board of Auditors, and the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee. Lastly, it invites the Sixth Committee to consider the legal aspects of this assessment and to provide advice for further discussion by the Fifth Committee.",
