 The United Nations General Assembly has adopted Resolution 77/275, which calls for a one-day high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response at UN Headquarters in New York on 20 September 2023. The meeting will consist of an opening segment, a plenary segment for general discussion, two multi-stakeholder panels, and a brief closing segment. The resolution also outlines the scope, modalities, format, and organization of the meeting, and encourages the highest possible level of participation from Member States and UN specialized agencies. It also requests the President of the General Assembly to organize an interactive multi-stakeholder hearing prior to the meeting.
