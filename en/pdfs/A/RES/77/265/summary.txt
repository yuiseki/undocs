 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/265 on 30 December 2022, authorizing the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in 2023 to meet unforeseen and extraordinary expenses arising during or after the year. The resolution also stipulates that the Secretary-General must report to the Advisory Committee and the General Assembly on all commitments made under the resolution, and that if a decision of the Security Council results in the need for the Secretary-General to enter into commitments relating to the maintenance of peace and security in an amount exceeding 10 million dollars, the matter must be brought to the General Assembly.
