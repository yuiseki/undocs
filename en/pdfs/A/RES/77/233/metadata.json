  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/233 on 15 December 2022, which calls for increased efforts to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, both online and offline. It recognizes the long-term trauma inflicted on victims, the need for multi-stakeholder partnerships, and the risk posed by the creation, possession, dissemination, and consumption of child sexual abuse materials. It also calls for standardized terminology, effective international cooperation, and the proactive design of products and services by Internet service and access providers. It requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to assist Member States in creating age- and gender-sensitive strategies and responses for preventing and combating child sexual exploitation and abuse, including online.",
