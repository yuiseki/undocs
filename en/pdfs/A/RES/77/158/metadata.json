The resolution reaffirms the commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and recognizes the severe impacts of the accelerated melting and retreat of glaciers on the climate, environment, human well-being, and sustainable development. It also recognizes the effects of global warming on the cryosphere and the need to raise awareness and promote sustainable measures towards preserving glaciers. The Government of Tajikistan has offered to host an international conference dedicated to glaciers' preservation in 2025 and the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the World Meteorological Organization are invited to facilitate implementation of the International Year and observance of the World Day.",
