  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/213 to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation. This resolution reaffirms the commitment to international cooperation as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and other documents, and emphasizes the need for dialogue among religions, cultures and civilizations in the field of human rights. It calls for states to cooperate with one another, and for the UN system to explore and foster complementarities among North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation. It also requests the Secretary-General and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to consult states and organizations on ways and means to enhance international cooperation in the UN human rights machinery.",
