 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/169 on 14 December 2022, reaffirming the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Agenda 21, the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. The resolution calls for a just balance between economic, social, and environmental needs, and encourages all parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to deposit their instruments of ratification. It also recognizes the importance of nature-based solutions, ecosystem-based approaches, and other management and conservation approaches in order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The resolution also calls for fundamental changes in the way societies produce and consume in order to achieve global sustainable development, and requests the Secretary-General to submit an action-oriented report to the General Assembly at its seventy-ninth session.
