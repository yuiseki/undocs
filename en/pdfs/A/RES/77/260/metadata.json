  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/260 endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on the Administration of Justice at the United Nations, emphasizing judicial independence and access for all staff members. It also requests the Secretary-General to continue to ensure a strong culture of accountability, to hold managers accountable for decisions that have led to litigation and financial loss, and to report on progress to the General Assembly. It also requests the Office of the United Nations Ombudsman and Mediation Services to provide observations on racism and racial discrimination, to provide a statistical overview of mediation cases, and to continue the pilot project for non-staff personnel. Finally, it invites the Sixth Committee to consider the legal aspects of the report to be submitted by the Secretary-General.",
