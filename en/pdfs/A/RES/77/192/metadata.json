  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/192 on 15 December 2022, reaffirming the right of Indigenous Peoples to have non-discriminatory access to all levels and forms of education. This resolution addresses the issue of literacy, particularly for women, and the need to ensure access to inclusive and equitable quality education, including digital literacy. It calls upon Member States to increase investment in inclusive and equitable quality education, including early childhood education, youth and adult literacy programmes, skills enhancement and lifelong learning. It also urges Member States and other relevant stakeholders to take measures to ensure the proper training of teachers and other educational professionals in digital literacy and the availability of and access to learning materials and remote learning platforms.",
