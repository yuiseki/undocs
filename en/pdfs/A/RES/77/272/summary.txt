 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/272, commending the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in implementing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The resolution also noted the Organisation's annual report for 2020 and its efforts to enhance the capacity of States parties and the Organisation to use chemistry for peaceful purposes and respond to threats involving toxic chemicals. It also outlines the cooperation between the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and recalls the intention of the Director General to include future reports of the OPCW fact-finding mission in the Security Council's monthly report.
