This resolution calls for policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development, respect of territorial integrity, national sovereignty, and political independence of states, and the transfer of sound technology from developed countries to developing countries on favourable terms. It also acknowledges the severe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for reform of the international financial system and the relevant institutions.",
