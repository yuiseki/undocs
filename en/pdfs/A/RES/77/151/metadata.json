  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/151 on 14 December 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development. This resolution addresses the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment for sustainable development, and calls for a rules-based, non-discriminatory, open, fair, inclusive, equitable and transparent multilateral trading system. It also underlines the importance of emergency measures to address food security concerns, welcomes the adoption of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, and urges the members of the World Trade Organization to ratify or accept the agreement. It requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 78th session on the implementation of the resolution and developments in the international trading system.",
