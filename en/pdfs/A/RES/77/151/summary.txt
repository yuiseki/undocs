It also underlines the importance of emergency measures to address food security concerns, welcomes the adoption of the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, and urges the members of the World Trade Organization to ratify or accept the agreement. It requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 78th session on the implementation of the resolution and developments in the international trading system.
