 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/250 seeks to prevent an arms race in outer space through negotiations for the early elaboration of legally binding multilateral agreements. It calls on all states, especially those with major space capabilities, to take urgent measures to prevent the placement of weapons in outer space and the threat or use of force in outer space. It also requests the Secretary-General to establish a United Nations Group of Governmental Experts to consider and make recommendations on substantial elements of an international legally binding instrument on the prevention of an arms race in outer space.
