 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/187 on 14 December 2022, reaffirming the permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources. This resolution expresses concern about the exploitation of natural resources by Israel, calls for the respect of human rights instruments, and demands that Israel cease the exploitation, damage, and depletion of natural resources. It also recognizes the right of the Palestinian people to claim restitution for any exploitation, damage, loss, depletion, or endangerment of their natural resources resulting from illegal measures taken by Israel and Israeli settlers. It calls for an end to the Israeli occupation that began in 1967 and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement on all tracks.
