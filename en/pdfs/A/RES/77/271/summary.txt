 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/271 on February 2023, reaffirming its commitment to addressing the special needs of Africa and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa. The resolution calls for the prevention and settlement of conflicts, promotion of human rights, democracy, and the rule of law, as well as adequate, predictable, and sustained financing for peacebuilding. It also calls for the international community to support and take action in areas critical to Africa's economic and social development, such as domestic resource mobilization, debt relief, improved market access, regional integration, and intra-African trade. Finally, it requests the Secretary-General to monitor and report on persistent and emerging challenges to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa.
