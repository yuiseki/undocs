 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/232 on 15 December 2022, which encourages Member States to develop comprehensive strategies to reduce reoffending through rehabilitation and reintegration. The resolution also encourages Member States to promote a rehabilitative environment in correctional facilities, take into account relevant UN standards and norms, incorporate respect for cultural diversity, and promote multi-stakeholder partnerships. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime is requested to convene an open-ended intergovernmental expert group to develop model strategies on reducing reoffending.
