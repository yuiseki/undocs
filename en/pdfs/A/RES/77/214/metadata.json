  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/214 on 15 December 2022, reaffirming its previous resolutions on the subject of human rights and unilateral coercive measures. This resolution expresses concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on international relations, trade, investment, and cooperation, particularly on vulnerable populations. It also recognizes the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on global efforts to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. The resolution urges all states to cease adopting or implementing any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law, and requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to give priority to the resolution in his annual report to the General Assembly. It also requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide resources for the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights.",
