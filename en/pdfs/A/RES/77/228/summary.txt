 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/228 expresses concern about the deteriorating human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran, including the death penalty, torture, arbitrary arrests, and discrimination against women and minorities. It calls upon the government to abolish public executions, cease the use of excessive force, uphold procedural guarantees, and eliminate systemic discrimination. It also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session on the progress made in the implementation of the resolution.
