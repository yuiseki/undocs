This includes the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the New Urban Agenda, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. It also reaffirms the importance of financing sustainable and resilient urbanization, the role of the World Urban Forum, and the need to reduce disaster risk. It encourages UN-Habitat to continue to support countries in the implementation of the New Urban Agenda, to assist in monitoring and reporting, and to collaborate with international development banks and the private sector. It also requests the Secretary-General to submit a progress report to the General Assembly at its 79th session on the implementation of the resolution.
