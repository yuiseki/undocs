 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/244 on 30 December 2022, which promotes inclusive and effective international tax cooperation at the United Nations. The resolution reaffirms the commitment of Member States to combat illicit financial flows, improve the fairness, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of their tax systems, and eliminate tax evasion, tax base erosion and profit shifting. It also notes the work of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, the 2022 special meeting of the Economic and Social Council on international cooperation in tax matters, and the Group of 20 Ministerial Tax Symposium on Taxation and Development. The resolution requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report analysing all relevant international legal instruments, other documents and recommendations that address international tax cooperation, and to consider the report at the seventy-eighth session of the General Assembly.
