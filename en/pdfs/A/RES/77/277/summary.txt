 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/277 recognizes the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme as an effective tool for conflict prevention in stemming the flow of conflict diamonds, and encourages wider participation in the scheme. It also acknowledges the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, workers, and their communities. The resolution selected Zimbabwe as Chair and the United Arab Emirates as Vice-Chair of the Kimberley Process for 2023, and requested the Chair of the Kimberley Process to submit a report to the General Assembly at its 78th session.
