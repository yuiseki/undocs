The resolution outlines the scope, modalities, format, and organization of the meeting, including the appointment of two co-chairs, the invitation of parliamentarians, local governments, UN entities, and other stakeholders, and the approval of a concise and action-oriented political declaration. It also requests the President of the General Assembly to convene an interactive multi-stakeholder hearing and encourages all Member States and UN specialized agencies to participate in the high-level meeting.
