  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly reaffirmed its commitment to South-South cooperation and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals and targets. It also noted the severe negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and encouraged all parties to the Paris Agreement to deposit their instruments of ratification. The resolution calls for the full implementation of the outcome document of the second High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, and encourages the United Nations entities to support developing countries in integrating development cooperation perspectives into the preparation and presentation of voluntary national review reports on sustainable development. It also welcomes the development of an initial conceptual framework for the measurement of South-South cooperation, and reaffirms the commitment at the heart of the 2030 Agenda to leave no one behind.",
