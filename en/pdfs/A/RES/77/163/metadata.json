  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/163 to promote the sustainable development of the Caribbean Sea for present and future generations. The resolution reaffirms the principles and commitments of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the Declaration of Barbados, the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States, the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development, the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. It calls for the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources, and encourages further efforts to prevent and reduce marine pollution. It also calls for the international community to provide financial, technical, and capacity-building assistance to Caribbean countries and their regional organizations in their efforts to implement the plan of action.",
