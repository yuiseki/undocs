  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/201 calls for the protection of children from bullying, including cyberbullying, and emphasizes the importance of digital literacy and skills in children and their parents or legal guardians. It also calls for investment in digital literacy and regulations to protect children from online harms, as well as addressing wider economic and social inequalities that may contribute to bullying. It further calls for measures and restorative practices to repair harm, generate and analyse statistical information, adopt and strengthen measures to prevent and protect children from bullying, and ensure child protection services are accessible and available to all children.",
