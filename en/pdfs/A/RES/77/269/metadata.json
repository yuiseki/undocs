  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/269, proclaiming 17 February as Global Tourism Resilience Day. The resolution reaffirms the commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and recognizes the importance of tourism in fostering economic growth, alleviating poverty, creating employment, and promoting sustainable consumption and production patterns. It also acknowledges the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism sector, and encourages the holding of high-level thematic events on tourism. The costs of activities arising from the resolution should be met through voluntary contributions, including from the private sector.",
