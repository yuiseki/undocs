  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/270 on 20 February 2023, reaffirming its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. The resolution seeks to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, and to achieve sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner. It also recognizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on African countries, calls for global collaboration to combat corruption and illicit financial flows, and encourages African countries to strengthen and expand local and regional infrastructure, eradicate poverty, achieve food security and nutrition, and strengthen national health systems. It also calls for targeted investments to combat diseases such as Ebola and COVID-19, and for the international community to support the implementation of the African Health Strategy 2016-2030 and the transition towards universal health coverage in Africa.",
