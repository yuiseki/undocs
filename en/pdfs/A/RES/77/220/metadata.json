  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/220 on 15 December 2022, which focuses on the promotion and protection of human rights and the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It expresses deep concern about the growing number of armed conflicts and the dramatic increase in persons reported missing in connection with armed conflict since 2014. The resolution calls for the prevention of persons from going missing, the determination of the identity and fate of missing persons, and the collection, protection, and management of data on missing persons. It also urges States to cooperate in solving cases of missing persons, and invites relevant human rights mechanisms and procedures to address the problem of persons reported missing in connection with armed conflict.",
