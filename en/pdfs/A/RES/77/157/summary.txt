 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/157 expresses deep concern about the destruction of oil storage tanks in Lebanon by the Israeli Air Force, which has caused an oil slick that has polluted the shores of Lebanon and Syria. It requests the Israeli government to assume responsibility for prompt and adequate compensation to Lebanon and Syria for the costs of repairing the environmental damage caused by the destruction, and invites States and the international donor community to make voluntary financial contributions to a trust fund.
