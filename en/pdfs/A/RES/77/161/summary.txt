 The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/161 in 2022, which promotes zero-waste initiatives to advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This resolution recognizes the important role of cities and rural areas in sustainable and environmentally sound waste management, and requests the Secretary-General to set up an advisory board of eminent persons and invites the United Nations Environment Programme to include a dedicated section on zero-waste initiatives in the next iteration of the Global Waste Management Outlook. It also proclaims 30 March as International Day of Zero Waste and invites all Member States, organizations of the United Nations system, other international and regional organizations, and other relevant stakeholders to observe the day through activities aimed at raising awareness of zero-waste initiatives and their contribution to achieving sustainable development.
