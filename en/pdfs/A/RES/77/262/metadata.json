  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/262 reaffirms the role of the Fifth Committee in carrying out a thorough analysis and approval of posts and financial resources, as well as of human resources policies. It also urges all Member States to fulfil their financial obligations as set out in the Charter of the United Nations on time, in full and without conditions. The resolution proposes a budget for 2023 that ensures equal treatment of all six official languages and equal quality of service for Member States, and takes note of the report of the Advisory Committee and decides on the distribution of proposed establishment of posts. It also increases the expected income from bank interests under income section 2 by 7,900,600 dollars and the income expected under income section 3 by 3,177,000 dollars.",
