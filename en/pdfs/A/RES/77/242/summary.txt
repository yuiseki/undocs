 The General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/242 to convene a high-level 2025 United Nations Conference to Support the Implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development in France in June 2025. The costs of the Conference and its preparation will be financed through extrabudgetary resources, and the Governments of Costa Rica and France have offered to co-host and assume the costs. The modalities of the Conference will be considered before the end of the seventy-seventh session of the General Assembly, and further opportunities to actively involve Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors in driving progress and supporting the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 will be considered.
