  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/222 on 15 December 2022, calling for a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and for states to reduce the number of offences for which it may be imposed. It also calls for states to ensure that those facing the death penalty can exercise their right to apply for pardon or commutation of their death sentence, and to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. It further encourages states which have abolished the death penalty not to reintroduce it.",
