  "summary": " The General Assembly of the United Nations reaffirmed its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and other conventions. It also recalled its resolution 47/196 of 22 December 1992, which declared 17 October the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, and its resolution 75/175 of 16 December 2020. This resolution calls for urgent national and international action to eliminate extreme poverty and its negative effects, and for the completion of the Millennium Development Goals and the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It also recognizes the need to tackle health inequities and inequalities, and calls for the design of recovery strategies based on sustainable financing policies to address the economic crisis and depression resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It further encourages states to take measures to eliminate discrimination against all persons, in particular those living in poverty, and to facilitate greater access to social protection and financial and business services for women. The resolution was adopted at the 54th plenary meeting on 15 December 2022.",
