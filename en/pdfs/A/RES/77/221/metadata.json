  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/221 on 15 December 2022, which reaffirms the right to freedom of religion or belief and condemns any violations of this right. It calls for intensified efforts to promote and protect the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, and to eliminate all forms of hatred, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. It also emphasizes the importance of education, including human rights education, in the promotion of tolerance. The resolution requests the Special Rapporteur to submit an interim report to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session, and decides to consider the question of the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance at its seventy-eighth session.",
