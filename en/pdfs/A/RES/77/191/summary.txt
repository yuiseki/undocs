 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/191 recognizes the thirtieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family in 2024 and calls for increased cooperation on family issues and concerted action to strengthen family-oriented policies and programmes. It encourages governments to continue their efforts to implement the objectives of the International Year of the Family, such as fighting poverty and hunger, and to invest in family-oriented policies and programmes. It also calls upon Member States, United Nations entities, and other relevant stakeholders to provide support to families, promote research and awareness-raising activities, and promote work-family balance. Finally, it requests the focal point on the family of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs to collaborate with regional commissions, funds, and programmes, and invites Member States to provide resources for those efforts.
