  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 77/261 on 30 December 2022, which reaffirms the high priority accorded to the work of the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. The resolution requests the Secretary-General to develop a compendium of lessons learned and best practices from the closure of predecessor tribunals, to report on the efforts made so far during the ongoing downsizing exercise, and to provide additional and detailed information on the final expenditures and unencumbered balance. It also approves the redeployment of one post of Chief Security Officer from Arusha to The Hague, and further reduces resources for general operating expenses and grants and contributions. The resolution appropriates a total amount of 81,945,300 dollars gross (74,951,200 dollars net) for 2023, and apportions the amount of 35,871,050 dollars gross (32,578,700 dollars net) among Member States in accordance with the scale of assessments applicable to the regular budget of the United Nations for 2023.",
