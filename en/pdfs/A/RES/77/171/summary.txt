 The United Nations General Assembly Resolution 77/171 calls for capacity-building, training, awareness-raising, and support for the formulation of national, regional, and interregional plans to mitigate and prevent sand and dust storm hazards. It reaffirms the Paris Agreement and encourages all parties to fully implement it, and acknowledges the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Asian and Pacific Centre for the Development of Disaster Information Management, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organization, and the World Meteorological Organization. It also calls for the convening of a regional ministerial meeting in the Islamic Republic of Iran to find solutions for regional environmental challenges, and for the fifth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly to be held in Nairobi in 2022.
