  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly voted on a resolution affirming the principle of permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources. The resolution was adopted by a recorded vote of 151 to 7, with 10 abstentions. It calls upon Israel to halt all actions that harm the environment in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan, including the dumping of waste materials, destruction of vital infrastructure, and demolition and confiscation of Palestinian homes and civilian infrastructure. It also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly on the implementation of the resolution.",
