  "summary": " This document is a revised draft resolution from the United Nations General Assembly's seventy-seventh session, concerning cooperation between the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. It takes note of the annual report for 2020 of the Organisation, commends the continued work of the Organisation to enhance the capacity of States parties and the Organisation to use chemistry for peaceful purposes, and responds to threats involving toxic chemicals. It calls for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to report to the Security Council, through the Secretary-General, on a monthly basis, and expresses appreciation for the work done in this regard. It also welcomes the monitoring by the Technical Secretariat of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of developments related to any possible use of chemical weapons.",
