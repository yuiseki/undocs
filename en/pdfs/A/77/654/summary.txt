 The United Nations General Assembly discussed the Administration of Justice at the United Nations during its seventy-seventh session. The Fifth Committee considered the item at its 14th, 18th and resumed 25th meetings, and adopted a draft resolution to establish a new, independent, transparent, professionalized, adequately resourced and decentralized system of administration of justice. The resolution requests the Secretary-General to ensure respect for the rights and obligations of staff members, accountability of managers and staff members, equal treatment of the six official languages of the United Nations, and a strong culture of accountability throughout the Secretariat. The resolution also encourages the use of mediation services as an effective method of dispute resolution, requests the Secretary-General to increase awareness of the informal resolution process, and affirms the powers of the Dispute Tribunal and Appeals Tribunal to hear and pass judgment on applications and appeals.
