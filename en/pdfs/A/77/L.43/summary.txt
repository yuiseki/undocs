 The United Nations General Assembly is proposing a resolution to proclaim 17 February as Global Tourism Resilience Day, in order to recognize the importance of sustainable tourism and its contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals. The resolution also encourages the holding of high-level thematic events on tourism, and requests the Secretary-General to bring the resolution to the attention of all Member States and relevant stakeholders. Costs of activities arising from the implementation of the resolution should be met through voluntary contributions.
