  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly adopted a draft resolution on the pattern of conferences for 2023, which includes the approval of the draft calendar of conferences and meetings of the United Nations for 2023, and authorizes the Committee on Conferences to make any necessary adjustments. The resolution also requests the Secretary-General to continue to ensure that Member States have equal opportunities to present their evaluations in the six official languages of the United Nations, and to explore best practices and techniques in client satisfaction evaluations. It also requests the Secretary-General to increase efforts to ensure equal treatment of official languages, to ensure the consistent and effective implementation of the terms of reference for the Coordinator, and to continue to improve the utilization of conference services. The resolution also requests the Secretary-General to continue to ensure the necessary support for documents in all six official languages, to enforce the slotting system more rigorously, and to take measures to ensure the highest quality of interpretation and translation services in all six official languages.",
