  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed the United Nations pension system at its seventy-seventh session. The Fifth Committee adopted a draft resolution on the United Nations pension system, which takes note of the reports of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board, the Secretary-General, and the Board of Auditors. The resolution also endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, emphasizes the existing prerogative of the General Assembly on matters pertaining to the Fund, and requests the Pension Board to provide a framework for the extension of guidelines to allow retrospective recognition of beneficiaries. The document also outlines the proposed budget for the Office of Investment Management for 2023, including the creation of 5 new posts, 8 conversions, and 1 reclassification.",
