  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed the Joint Inspection Unit at its seventy-seventh session and adopted a draft resolution without a vote. The resolution reaffirms the Unit's statute and unique role, takes note of the Unit's report and programme of work for 2023, and stresses the importance of the Unit's oversight functions. It also recognizes the need to enhance the Unit's impact on the management efficiency and transparency of the participating organizations, and welcomes the coordination of the Unit with the Board of Auditors and the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The resolution also encourages the Unit to review the long-term effectiveness of its implemented recommendations and update the Assembly in 2024.",
