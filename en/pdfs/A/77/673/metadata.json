  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations at its seventy-seventh session. The Fifth Committee proposed a draft resolution and decision to shift the management paradigm in the United Nations by reviewing changes to the budgetary cycle, and requested the Secretary-General to conduct a comprehensive review of the annual cycle and submit a report for consideration in 2028. The General Assembly also requested the Secretary-General to ensure effective and efficient utilization of available resources and programme delivery, and deferred consideration of eight documents related to the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations until the first part of its resumed seventy-seventh session.",
