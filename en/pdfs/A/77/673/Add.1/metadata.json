The Committee has recommended the adoption of the resolution, which reaffirms the commitment to accountability and recognizes the importance of results-based management. The Committee also recommends the deferral of consideration of documents related to the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations, investing in prevention and peacebuilding, the programme budget for 2023, capital investment planning, and the information and communications technology strategy until the second part of the resumed seventy-seventh session and the main part of the seventy-eighth session, respectively.",
