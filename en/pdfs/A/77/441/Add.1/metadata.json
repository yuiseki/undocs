  "summary": " The Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly adopted a draft resolution (A/C.2/77/L.5/Rev.1) at its 25th meeting, reaffirming its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, and the World Trade Organization decision WT/MIN(15)/48-WT/L/982 and WT/L/508/Add.1. This resolution calls for countries to utilize flexibilities consistent with their WTO commitments and obligations, and emphasizes the importance of special and differential treatment, the Agreement on Trade Facilitation, and the elimination of the use of unilateral economic, financial or trade measures. It also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of the resolution and developments in the international trading system to the General Assembly at its seventy-eighth session.",
