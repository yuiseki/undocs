  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed macroeconomic policy questions, including international trade and development, international financial system and development, external debt sustainability and development, and promotion of international cooperation to combat illicit financial flows and strengthen good practices on assets return to foster sustainable development. The Committee heard introductory statements and took action on the item, resulting in the adoption of a draft resolution to promote international tax cooperation and combat illicit financial flows. The resolution calls for countries to work together to strengthen transparency, adopt appropriate policies, and exchange tax information. The Secretary-General has been requested to prepare a report analysing relevant international legal instruments, and to consult with Member States, the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, the Platform for Collaboration on Tax, and other international institutions and stakeholders.",
