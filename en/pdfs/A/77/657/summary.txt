 The United Nations General Assembly discussed Agenda items 136 and 148, which focused on the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and the report on the activities of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The Fifth Committee recommended the adoption of a draft resolution, A/C.5/77/L.15, which reaffirmed the primary role of the General Assembly in the consideration of reports, the oversight role of the Fifth Committee, the independence and separate roles of the internal and external oversight mechanisms, and the important roles of the Office of Internal Oversight Services. The resolution also requested the Secretary-General to ensure that the annual reports of the Office continue to include a brief description of any impairment of its independence.
