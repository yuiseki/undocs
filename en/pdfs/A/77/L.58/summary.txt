 The United Nations General Assembly is requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States in respect of climate change. This request is in line with the General Assembly's resolution 77/165 and other resolutions and decisions relating to the protection of the global climate. It also recalls the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, noting with concern the gap between the aggregate effect of States' current nationally determined contributions and the emission reductions required to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It expresses concern over the adverse effects of climate change and requests an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the obligations of States under international law to protect the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.
