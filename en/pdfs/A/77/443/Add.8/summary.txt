 The Second Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a substantive debate on agenda item 18 (h) and adopted a draft resolution entitled “Harmony with Nature” (A/C.2/77/L.60). The resolution reaffirms the commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and targets by 2030, eradicating poverty, and creating an enabling environment for sustainable development. It also recognizes the importance of nature-based solutions, the Paris Agreement, and the New Urban Agenda in achieving the goals. It requests the President of the General Assembly to convene an interactive dialogue among Member States on 24 April 2023 to discuss the possibility of a high-level meeting, tentatively entitled “Earth Assembly”, to be held on 22 April 2024. It also requests the Secretary-General to provide adequate support for the meeting and encourages the experts of the Harmony with Nature Knowledge Network to carry out a study.
