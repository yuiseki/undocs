 The United Nations General Assembly is considering a draft resolution to promote and mainstream easy-to-understand communication for accessibility for persons with disabilities. The resolution reaffirms the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and calls for Member States to address obstacles and barriers to accessibility in information, communications, and other services. It also requests the Secretary-General to bring the resolution to the attention of all governments, regional intergovernmental organizations, the United Nations system, and other stakeholders, and to produce a version of the resolution in an accessible format and with easy-to-understand language.
