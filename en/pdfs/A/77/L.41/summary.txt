 The United Nations General Assembly has proposed a draft resolution to declare 12 February the International Day for the Prevention of Violent Extremism as and when Conducive to Terrorism. The resolution reaffirms the commitment of Member States to taking measures to address the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, while respecting international law. It also invites all Member States, entities of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Coordination Compact, and other relevant stakeholders to commemorate the International Day in an appropriate manner. The cost of activities arising from the implementation of the resolution should be met from voluntary contributions.
