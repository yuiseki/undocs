  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly is considering a draft resolution to organize a high-level meeting on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The resolution recalls previous resolutions on the International Day of Epidemic Preparedness and elevating pandemic prevention, preparedness and response to the highest level of political leadership. It also recognizes the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on low- and middle-income countries, and the need to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The resolution outlines a one-day high-level meeting to be held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on 20 September 2023, and encourages Member States and members of the United Nations specialized agencies to participate. It also requests the President of the General Assembly to finalize the organizational arrangements for the meeting.",
