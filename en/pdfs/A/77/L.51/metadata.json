  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly is reaffirming its commitment to the political declaration on the fight against tuberculosis adopted in 2018, and is deciding to convene a high-level meeting on tuberculosis in 2023 in New York to review the achievement of agreed tuberculosis goals and identify gaps and solutions to accelerate progress. The meeting will consist of an opening segment, a plenary segment, two multi-stakeholder panels and a brief closing segment. The President of the General Assembly is invited to appoint Heads of State or Government from countries with successful tuberculosis control programmes to attend the meeting, and all Member States and members of the United Nations specialized agencies are encouraged to participate. The proceedings of the high-level meeting and the multi-stakeholder hearing will be webcast.",
