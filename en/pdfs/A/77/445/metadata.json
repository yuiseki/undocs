  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed the item of \"Globalization and Interdependence\" at its seventy-seventh session. The Second Committee held a general discussion on the item, heard the introduction of draft proposals, and took action on the item. The Committee adopted a draft resolution entitled “Towards a New International Economic Order” (A/C.2/77/L.46) which reaffirms the need to continue working towards a new international economic order based on principles of equity, sovereign equality, interdependence, common interest, cooperation and solidarity among all states. It also reiterates the need to refrain from unilateral economic, financial or trade measures, and calls for the fulfilment of commitments to pursue policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development.",
