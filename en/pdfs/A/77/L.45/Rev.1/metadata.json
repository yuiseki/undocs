  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly has drafted a resolution on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, sponsored by the Group of 77 and China, to reaffirm its commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, and the United Nations Declaration on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development. The resolution calls for global solidarity to ensure equitable, affordable, and timely access to vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other medical products, and for the full implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. It also encourages African countries to invest in digitalization and frontier technologies, and requests the United Nations system to provide assistance to the New Partnership and to African countries.",
