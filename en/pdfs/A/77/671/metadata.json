  "summary": " The United Nations General Assembly discussed the item \"United Nations Common System\" at its 77th session. The Fifth Committee adopted draft decisions and a draft resolution to amend articles 10 and 11 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission, which would clarify the Commission's authority and affect the current operational reality. The General Assembly also requested the Commission to review the jurisdictional set-up of the United Nations common system, and invited the Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Dispute Tribunal, and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal to provide written opinions on a matter by December 1, 2022.",
