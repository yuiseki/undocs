A draft resolution was rejected by a recorded vote of 19 to 83, with 49 abstentions. An amended draft resolution was adopted by a recorded vote of 88 to 18, with 46 abstentions. The resolution reaffirms the role of the Committee for Programme and Coordination, reiterates the need for Member States to participate in the budget preparation process, and endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination on the proposed programme plan for 2023 and programme performance for 2021.",
