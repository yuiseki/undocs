 The United Nations General Assembly is discussing the role of diamonds in fuelling conflict and the need to break the link between illicit transactions of rough diamonds and armed conflict. The resolution recognizes the positive impact of the Kimberley Process, an international initiative led by participants, in improving the lives of people in diamond-mining communities and contributing to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It also calls for continued regional and international action to prevent conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade, and has selected Zimbabwe as Chair and the United Arab Emirates as Vice-Chair of the Kimberley Process for 2023.
